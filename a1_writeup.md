# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

My initial thought is that it is fun but hard to learn and has a lor of pre installed functions that are really helpful

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

it is different in the sense that you do not have to put var in from of each variable but it is similar in the sense that you do not have to tell the computer whather each variable is a string or integer, it has similar things like for loops, lists, function and so on but it is different in the sense that the wordings might be slightly different or the way uou have to make them differ.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

that working with chatgpt in a clas like this is really helpful and there is almost no way to remeber so you will most likely have to search things up even if you have a carrer
